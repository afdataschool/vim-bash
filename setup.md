You need to download some files to follow this lesson:

1. Download [data-shell.zip]({{ page.root }}/data/data-shell.zip) and move the file to your `dataschool` directory.
2. Unzip/extract the file (ask your instructor if you need help with this step). You should end up with a new folder called **data-shell** within your `dataschool` directory.
3. Open a terminal and type `cd`, then press the Enter key. That last step will make sure you start with your home folder as your working directory.
